<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
If the script isn't working here are some things you can try:

- Make sure that your tracklist and timestamps files are named correctly
- Make sure that you have the same number of timestamps and track titles
- Make sure your timestamps aren't exceeding the length of the long file
- Make sure your timestamp file, tracklist file, and the orignal long file are in the same folder.
